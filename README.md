# Single Hand Gesture Recognition 

Algorithm use:CNN , KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM 

Objective:The goal of this project is to develop a robust gesture recognition system by training multiple machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The system is designed to recognize single-hand gestures with high accuracy, facilitating applications in areas such as human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and assistive technologies. The focus is on optimizing the model architecture and fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve the highest possible prediction accuracy.

Output:The final system will be capable of predicting hand gestures with very high accuracy, ensuring reliable and efficient recognition of single-hand gestures in real-time.
